## Bad Design and User Experience of Wangsit Education Website

First of all, I analyze this website from Desktop browser. I visited this website since 2017 and today, the principal design didn't change at all (from my perspective). Wangsit Education Website is categorized to _Online Shopping_. This website sells _SBMPTN, SIMAK UI, UTUL UGM_ books.

Let's breakdown the bad side of this website.

1. This website doesn't optimize for desktop experience.

    Website's layout doesn't give modern layout experience. It is a kind of old website design. Navigation bar's padding is too big and text inside _navbar_ not properly fit with its parent (navbar). Login/signup and cart box also doesn't give interesting looks. It's too much padding . Otherwise, cart counter item works as it should be.

2. Homepage only show _new arrival_ books.

    It is not problem to show new arrival product only but its should give another product on other page. From my opinion, if we can't find another product than what it show on homepage, the homepage caption should not write "_New Arrival_". It just makes an ambiguous to visitor. This is a minor issue, I think.

3. There is no **search product** feature.

    Most _Online Shopping_ websites give search product feature on their site. It is important to user to give usability on what user wanted from online shop. But this is minor issue considering this website only show new product.

4. A mobile version.

    I curious about what this website looks when browsing using mobile browser. When I visited, there is differences between mobile version and desktop version. First, there is a _search_ product feature on mobile version. Second, website looks **more compact** and a little bit better than desktop version. But it is give inconsistency because there is differences between its two version.

5. No pagination on mobile version.

    Pagination is important for simplicity experience. Especially on mobile when scrolling is a bit frustrating when dealing with long content.

6. Useless option.

    ![useless radio button](images/useless-radio-button.png)

    I don't know what "lainnya" means because this owner only give instruction to pay with _transfer to bank account_. I think its radio button is useless because many visitor will choose "_transfer bank_" option.

7. Inconsistent layout

    Form doesn't look good because its layout not fit with other form. Most importantly, whole website has ugly font and font size so its gives difficult to read.
